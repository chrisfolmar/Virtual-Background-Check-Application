## IP Verification Application 

## This application utilizes the [Apility.io's Free Blacklist API](https://apility.io/) to demonstrate how a system could look up a user's IP Address and know immediately if they are [blacklisted](https://www.whatismyip.com/why-is-my-ip-blacklisted/) so that it can decide to block them from accessing your application if necessary.
